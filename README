Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) composition has emerged as an effective mechanism for IoT environments to integrate multiple services to meet diverse
and evolving application requirements. However, predicting the performance of a new service or unseen service combination remains a critical
challenge without manual evaluation. Traditional QoS prediction approaches are structure-centric and are not well suited for
MLaaS composition, as they fail to capture the semantic relationships among composed services. To address this, we propose
a Semantic-driven MLaaS Composability (SDMC) framework that enables performance prediction for unseen service combina-
tions without executing the composition. SDMC learns semantic relationships from historical compositions by jointly capturing
functional compatibility and non-functional interaction patterns. This enables the proposed model accurately estimates compo-
sition performance under partial correspondence and evolving service conditions. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets
demonstrate that SDMC consistently reduces prediction errors by up to 30% compared to a baseline approach. Moreover, the
proposed SDMC framework provides a scalable and effective predictive capability across diverse service combinations and
